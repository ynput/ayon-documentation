## Overview

The inbox is an email-inspired feature that consolidates all your updates and notifications across AYON. Designed for more than just listing notifications, it serves as a hub of organization and prioritization. With two tabs, "Important" and "Other," it ensures that crucial messages don't get lost in the production noise. Related notifications, such as multiple messages about the same folder, are grouped together for better clarity.

Think of the inbox as a dynamic to-do list for tasks that require your attention. You can mark messages as read to revisit them later, or clear them once you're done to keep your workflow organized.

:::tip
The inbox has full keyboard support! Hover over any message and press `X` to mark it as read/unread or `C` to clear/unclear.

**Important Messages Examples**

-   You are directly mentioned in the comment. For example: `Looks great @Felix Peterson`.
-   You are a watcher on a task.
-   You are assigned to or removed from a task and therefore become a watcher.
-   You make a comment and therefore become a watcher.

**Other Messages Examples**

-   You are removed from a task.
-   New activity on entities you are assigned to or have authored, including:
    -   Comments
    -   Status changes
    -   Assignee changes

## Watchers

Watchers are users who receive important notifications about changes to an entity. This is useful in scenarios where you may not be directly working on an entity but still need to stay updated.

Watchers are often added automatically. For example, posting a comment on an entity will automatically add you as a watcher so you can receive updates such as replies to your comment. Similarly, being assigned to a task will add you as a watcher to that task.

You can manually update your watcher status using the bell icon in the toolbar at the top of the entityâ€™s details panel. A blue bell indicates that you are watching the entity.
