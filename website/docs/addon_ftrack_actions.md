Actions are small useful tools that help artists, managers and administrators.
To avoid overfilled action menu some actions are filtered by entity types and some of them by user roles permissions.

In most cases actions filtered by entity type:
- Project
- Typed Context
    - Folder
    - Episode
    - Sequence
    - Shot
    - Library
    - Asset Build
    - Asset Variant
    - Epic
    - Milestone
- Task
- Asset Version
- Component
- Review Session

*Typed Context* is global Ftrack entity for hierarchical types representing all of them. Hierarchical types can be used for filtering too, but because they are dynamic *(you can add, modify and remove them)*, *Typed Context* is used to be more general.

So if you do not see action you need to use check if action is available for selected *entity type* or ask *administrator* to check if you have permissions to use it.

:::note
Actions can be heavily customised by your studio, so this guide might not fit 100 %.
:::

:::important
Filtering can be more complicated for example a lot of actions can be shown only when one particular entity is selected.

## Applications

### Launch applications
* Entity types: Task
* User roles: All

These actions *launch application with AYON * and *start timer* for the selected Task. We recommend you to launch application this way.

:::important
Project Manager or Supervisor must set project's applications during project preparation otherwise you won't see them. Applications can be added even if the project is in progress.

## AYON Admin

</div>
<div class="col col--2 markdown">

![pype_admin-icon](assets/ftrack/ftrack-pype_admin-icon.png)

</div>
</div>


#### A group of actions that are used for AYON Administration.

### Sync to AYON
* Entity types: Project, Typed Context
* User roles: Pypeclub, Administrator, Project manager

Synchronization to AYON is key process to keep AYON data updated. Action updates selected entities (Project, Shot, Sequence, etc.) and all nested entities to AYON database. If action is successfully finished [Sync Hier Attrs](#sync-hier-attrs) action is triggered.

There are 2 versions of **Sync to AYON**, first labeled as **server** second as **local**.
* **server** version will be processed with [event server](addon_ftrack_admin.md#event-server)
* **local** version will be processed with user's AYON tray application

It is recommended to use **local** version if possible to avoid unnecessary deceleration of event server.

### Sync Hier Attrs
* Entity types: Project, Typed Context
* User roles: Pypeclub, Administrator, Project manager

Synchronization to AYON of Ftrack's hierarchical Custom attributes is a bit complicated so we decided to split synchronization process into 2 actions. This action updates hierarchical Custom attributes of selected entities (Project, Shot, Sequence, etc.) and all their nested entities to pipeline database. This action is also triggered automatically after successfully finished [Sync To AYON](#sync-to-ayon) action.

There are 2 versions of **Sync Hier Attrs** first labeled as **server** second as **local**.
* **server** version will be processed with [event server](addon_ftrack_admin.md#event-server)
* **local** version will be processed with user's AYON application

It is recommended to use **local** version if possible to avoid unnecessary deceleration of event server.

### Job Killer
* Entity types: All
* User roles: Pypeclub, Administrator

Custom Jobs in Ftrack help to track process and status of triggered actions but sometimes unexpected failure of action may happen *(Please let us know when happens)*. The failure will cause that job's status will remain set to **Running** which may cause issues in future.

This action gives ability to *stop running jobs*. When action is triggered, an interface with all running jobs with checkbox next to each is shown. Status of checked jobs will be set to **Failure** on submit.

### Delete Assets by Name
* Entity types: Typed Context, Task
* User roles: Pypeclub, Administrator

With this action it's possible to delete up to 15 entities at once from active project in pipeline database. Entered names must match exactly the names stored in database. These entities also must not have children entities *(Sequence must not have Shots but Task is not entity)*.

## Create Project Structure

![create_project_folders-icon](assets/ftrack/ftrack-create_project_folders-icon.png)

</div>
</div>

* Entity types: Project
* User roles: Pypeclub, Administrator

*Create Project Structure* helps to create basic folder structure and may create the main ftrack entities for the project.

Structure is loaded from settings *(AYON Settings → Project → Global → Project Folder Structure)*. You should examine these settings to see how it works. Settings may contain dictionaries of nested dictionaries where each key represents a folder name. Key and all it's parents will be also created in Ftrack if the key ends with `[ftrack]`. Default Ftrack entity type is *Folder* but entity type can be specified using `[ftrack.{entity type}]`. To create *Sequence* with name *Seq_001* key should look like `Seq_001[ftrack.Sequence]`.

:::note
Please keep in mind this action is meant to make your project setup faster at the very beginning, but it does not create folders for each shot and asset. For creating asset folder refer to `Create Folders` Action
