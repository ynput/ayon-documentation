:::caution Nuke License compatibility
The AYON Nuke addon integration is compatible exclusively with the `commercial` license of Nuke, which provides Full Python API Support and pipeline functionality. Please note that the `non-commercial` and `indie` licenses lack full Python API support and, as a result, are not supported by the addon.

For more details, check out the comparison between different Nuke licenses [here](https://learn.foundry.com/nuke/content/getting_started/meet_nuke/about_indie.html).
