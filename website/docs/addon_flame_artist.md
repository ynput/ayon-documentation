### Publishable Clip

Steps for making a publishable clip:
- Select your clips in the timeline.
- Go to **AYON -> Create**, and select **Create Publishable Clip**.
- **AYON publish attributes creator** window will appear where you can specify multiple options for your publish instance.
- After that, you can go to **AYON -> Publish** which runs some validations before exporting and publishing your clip.

Once you create a publish instance, you'll start noticing that your clip is marked.
these marks are objects that hold AYON publish metadata.

:::info AYON Publish attributes creator

**AYON publish attributes creator** provides various options for you to tweak your publish instances.
e.g. You can rename the clips, specify frame padding and etc.
<!-- TODO: Break down the creator options -->

#### Vertical workflow
* For a vertical workflow you need to first rename sequence tracks, so they can be used as product variant names. Just simply RMB click on the track and select _Rename Track_.

![ayon_vertical_alignment](assets/flame/artist/ayon_vertical_alignment.png)

* In the **AYON Publish Attributes creator** window, enable _Enable Vertical Sync_ and select the _Hero track_ for Shot parenting. These hold the Shot metadata that needs to be distributed to other child clips, which are vertically aligned. Then in the _Product name_ set the option to `[track name]`

* Confirm the changes by Create button and see that those clips were marked with the AYON marks.


<!-- TODO: Add a note about publish plugins so that artists are aware of the changes that happens on publishing? -->

## Loading Products

You can load products using [AYON Loader](artist_tools_loader.md) like any other addons.

Currently, we place the loaded media in the Media Panel as Reels or Batch clips with conversion to OpenClip. This allows you to manually place them in the timeline as needed.

## Manage versions of loaded clips

Flame addon, *unlike other addons,* doesn't include **Inventory manager**.
Alternatively, you should be able to set versions of your loaded media via Reels and Media panel menus using `Source Versions` action.
