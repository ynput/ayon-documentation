## How to use it?

**Just Drag and Drop**, That's how to use it.

Tray Publisher is nothing different than the regular [publisher](artist_tools_publisher.md) tool.
It implements two additional fields to drag and drop your files you want to publish. 

import how_to_use_tray_publisher from './assets/traypublisher/how_to_use_tray_publisher.mp4'

<video controls style={{width: "100%" }}>
  <source src={how_to_use_tray_publisher}/>
</video>


## Supported Product Types 

Tray Publisher supports publishing almost any type of data across the pipeline.
It also supports special creators for advanced publishes.


### Simple Create Plugins

:::tip Simple Create Plugins
Simple Create Plugins are defined in the [Simple Create Plugins](addon_traypublisher_admin.md#simple-create-plugins) addon settings.
Admins are able to change (remove/add/modify) them.
:::

Every simple creator shares the same usage.

![](assets/traypublisher/artist/creator_plugins.png)
*In this example, I've prefixed the labels of simple creators with `(à´Ÿ)` for easy identification.*

#### Usage
- Select Folder and task from left side.
- Drag & drop Representations and reviewable representations.
- Create
- (optional) Set publish options
- Publish

#### Key Create Options
1. Variant: Product's variant name.
2. Thumbnail: Product's Thumbnail.
3. Representations: Files to include in your publish. The field can allow multiple items. each item can be a single file or file sequences. the field provides hints about the configuration of the representations filed.
4. Reviewable representation: Supports a single reviewable item. it can be a single file or file sequences.

#### Default Simple Creators
- `workfiles`: Workfiles are full scenes from any application that are directly edited by artists. They represent a state of work on a task at a given point and are usually not directly referenced into other scenes.
- `model`: Models should only contain geometry data, without any extras like cameras, locators or bones. *Keep in mind that models published from tray publisher are not validated for correctness.* 
- `pointcache`: Alembic or bgeo cache of animated data
- `plate`: Any type of image seqeuence coming from outside of the studio. Usually camera footage, but could also be animatics used for reference.
- `render`: Sequence or single file renders.
- `camera`: Ideally this should be only camera itself with baked animation, however, it can technically also include helper geometry.
- `image`: Any image data can be published as image product type. References, textures, concept art, matte paints. This is a fallback 2d product type for everything that doesn't fit more specific product type.
- `vdb`: Hierarchical data structure for the efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data discretized on three-dimensional grids.
- `matchmove`: Script exported from matchmoving application to be later processed into a tracked camera with additional data.
- `rig`: CG rigged character or prop. Rig should be clean of any extra data and directly loadable into it's respective application.	
- `simpleUnrealTexture`: Texture files with Unreal Engine naming conventions.
- `audio`: Audio files for review or final delivery.
