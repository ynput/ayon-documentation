## Multi view slicer

The slicer lets you quickly refine your view by filtering attributes on the fly, without modifying your existing filters. It’s a fast and flexible way to explore data, helping you focus on what matters most—without disrupting your workflow. Slice by hierarchy, assignee, status, and task type, with more coming soon.

:::note
Currently, the slicer is only available on the Task Progress page, but we plan to bring it to more pages in the future.

## Annotations

Enhance collaboration with **Annotations**, allowing you to draw directly on videos and images for clearer communication.

-   Mark up any frame of a video or image.
-   Adjust brush size and erase with a simple right-click.
-   Choose from preset colours, pick a custom shade, or use the eyedropper tool.
-   Full keyboard support.

Annotations are currently in beta, so you may encounter bugs. Please let us know if you do!

## Reviewables transcoder service

The **Reviewables transcoder service** automatically transcodes and optimises any video format to meet web and browser standards, ensuring smooth playback in the browser. By default, only specific `.mp4` formats are supported for publishing and playback due to browser limitations. This service takes care of transcoding your reviewables into the compatible format for you.

:::note
This feature is still under development and not currently available. Please contact support if this is something that your studio requires.

## Full pipeline release access

With **Power Features**, you gain access to not just the latest pipeline release, but all historical releases. By default, only the latest release is available.

## SSO (OAuth2.0, Google)

Let your users log in using any SSO provider instead of email and password. Google SSO and Discord SSO are natively supported, and all other providers are supported through **Keycloak**. We can also add more providers natively upon request, thanks to AYON’s OAuth2.0 capabilities. Configure it so that SSO logins automatically create new users with the correct details, such as name and profile image.
