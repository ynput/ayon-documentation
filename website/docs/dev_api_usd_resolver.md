## AYON USD Resolver Project

The Ayon USD Resolver enables resolution of Ayon URIs and pinning files using Pixar's Open USD.
It's designed to turn URIs with the `ayon://` or `ayon+entity://` formats into local file paths.

:::tip AYON USD Resolver Standard

AYON USD Resolver is an [AR2.0](https://openusd.org/release/wp_ar2.html) resolver and will not support AR1.0 resolution.
Make sure that your software package is compatible with the `AR2.0` standard or use the **defaults** we provide in the [AYON USD Addon](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-usd)
