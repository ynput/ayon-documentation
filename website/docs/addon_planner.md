The Planner Addon facilitates the planning of your productions, from initial outlining to detailed scheduling of tasks and artists. It can be extended for your own use cases, such as adding personal vacations or booking freelancers.

:::warning
The Planner Addon is an early preview release and the documentation is a work in progress. It may contain bugs and experience instability. We welcome your feedback to help shape its development.

The addon can be split up in two specific areas, the planning of high level, rough phases and detailed task scheduling.

## Phase Planner

The Phase Planner allows you to map out production timelines without needing exact dates, tasks, or assigned personnel. This helps estimate the duration of different production phases and reserve time for them.

It’s not limited to project planning; it can also be used for other calendar-based events, such as tracking team availability or vacations.

### Studio and Project Planning

The Phase Planner can be viewed at both the project level and the studio level.

To see plans for all projects across the studio, go to **Home > Planner** (`/dashboard/addon/planner`). This view helps you compare project timelines and avoid scheduling conflicts. You can also create **custom tracks** that aren’t tied to a specific project, such as studio-wide vacations.

For planning within a specific project, we recommend using the Planner tab inside that project for a more focused experience. Open the project from the sidebar and navigate to **Planner**.

### Planner Events

To create a new event in the Planner, first create a **track**, then click and drag to set the event's duration.  
Planner events are independent entities, separate from tasks and the AYON pipeline. Think of them like calendar events rather than task-based assignments.

#### Required Fields

Every event must have the following:

-   **Event Type** – Choose from **Phase, Time Off,** or **Milestone**
-   **Title** – Often auto-filled
-   **Start and End Dates** – Minimum duration of 1 day

#### Optional Fields

-   **People** – Assign relevant team members
-   **Task Types** – Indicate the types of tasks this event relates to
-   **Tags** – Customizable colored labels for additional context

### Planner Tracks

Tracks help keep your plans organized and manageable. Instead of handling all events in a single, cluttered timeline, tracks allow you to structure events into separate lanes; similar to timeline tracks in video editing software like **DaVinci Resolve** or **Premiere Pro**.  
Tracks are highly flexible and can represent anything. For example, you might create a separate track for each episode in a series.

#### Track Features

-   **Duplicate & Move** – Easily duplicate and reposition tracks, making it simple to set up template tracks for recurring structures like episodes.
-   **Rename** – Click on a track's title to rename it.
-   **Change Color** – Click on the colored track icon to pick its color or **Right-click** to select a suggested color automatically.

### Scenarios

Scenarios let you explore and edit plans without affecting your main schedule. Think of them like separate sheets in a spreadsheet, each scenario has its own independent set of events.

#### Scenario Features

-   **Independent Event Sets** – Changes in one scenario don’t impact others.
-   **Duplicate Scenarios** – Easily duplicate existing scenarios to test different planning approaches.
-   **Set as Live** – Once finalized, tag a scenario as **“Live”** to make it the active production plan.
-   **Reordering** – Click and drag a scenario to reorder it.

:::note
Scenarios are only available within **project-specific plans**. The **studio-level planner** always displays the **Live** scenario from each project.

## Scheduler

The scheduler is designed to schedule out specific tasks and assign artists to those tasks. Schedules are always created within the context of a project. The planner can be used to help inform how a schedule should be created, offering a clear overview of project phases and milestones to guide scheduling decisions.

_The scheduler is currently in development._
