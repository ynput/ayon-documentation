## Configuring addon

First, you need to install the addon. It's available from Ayon market or you can install it from its repository. For that follow our [developer documentation](addon_aquarium_developer.md) or [Ayon's manual installation guide](admin_server_installing_addons.md)

### Getting Aquarium bot

Synchronizing Ayon and Aquarium rely on a specific account type called Bot.

Go into your Aquarium `project settings`, `connectors` tab and select `Ayon`.

Select an existing bot, or create a dedicated bot for this project

![Select or create a bot](assets/aquarium/ayon-connector-bot.png)

When you create a bot, a `bot secret` is created. It's like a password, but for bot. So keep it safe ! It won't be shown twice. If you lost that secret, you will need to generate a new one.

### Setting Ayon Secrets

Go back to Ayon. From your `Studio settings`, select your `Secret` tab, and create two new secrets :

 - One to store your bot_key
 - Another one to store your bot_secret

Choose the name you want, but if you don't have any idea, `aq_bot_key` and `aq_bot_secret` is a good start üëç

- **Sync settings** is all the settings for synching data
  - **Default sync info** regroup all default data transformation. It's used to transform Aquarium data to Ayon. Those settings are optional, if they are not provided, the addon will try to translate it for you.
    - **Tasks** is for translating Aquarium's tasks to Ayon's tasks names
    - **Statuses** is for transforming Aquarium's tasks statuses to Ayon's statuses


## Starting Ayon Aquarium addon service

Aquarium addon rely on two services to synchronize your projects:

- Leecher, responsible to listening Aquarium events, and store them into Ayon's database for later process
- Processor, responsible to processing specific Aquarium events, stored in Ayon's database. The processor "only" transform the data and then pass it to the Addon API.

This requires to ASH to be working so the service can be attached to it. In main menu select Services.

![Ayon services menu](assets/aquarium/ayon-services.png)

Use **New service** button.

![Spawn new service](assets/aquarium/ayon-spawn-service.png)

Once ASH is working then worker options should be offering any available workers. Find `Aquarium` addon name and the same version which is used in your bundle. For easier late recognition, make sure to prefix your service with `aquarium_` or just `aq_`. Hit **Spawn** and wait for status of service to be set to green *Running*.
