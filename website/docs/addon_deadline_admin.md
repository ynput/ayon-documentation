## Introduction

AYON integration for Deadline primarily uses the Deadline web service to send jobs.

The integration consists of two parts:
- The Deadline custom plugins.
- A `GlobalJobPreLoad` Deadline Script (triggered for each Deadline job submitted via the Deadline addon).

The `GlobalJobPreLoad` script manages the population of submitted jobs with the correct environment variables, using settings from the AYON Deadline Plug-in.

Additionally, the addon streamlines Unreal Deadline submissions by utilizing the version control addon. See [Unreal Engine 5 Plug-in](#unreal-engine-5-plug-in).


## Preparation

For [AWS Thinkbox Deadline](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/deadline) support, you'll need to set up a few things in both AYON and Deadline itself.

1. **Deploy AYON Launcher**: Install the AYON launcher on all nodes of the Deadline farm. See [Install & Run](admin_launcher_distribute.md) for guidance.
2. **Set Up Deadline Web API Service**: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/web-service.html) to set up the Deadline Web API service.
3. **Install Custom Plugin and Scripts**: Copy the contents of `ayon/modules/deadline/repository` to `path/to/your/deadline/repository`. Refer to [Deadline Custom Plug-ins](#deadline-custom-plug-ins) for more details.
4. **Create a New AYON Bundle**: Include the Deadline Addon version in your new AYON Bundle.
5. **Configure Deadline Addon Settings**: See [Addon Settings](#addon-settings) for configuration details.
6. **Select Deadline Server**: By default, it uses the `default` server defined in the studio settings. See [System Deadline Webservice Info](#system-deadline-webservice-info). However, you can choose which Deadline server should be used for your project at  `ayon+settings://deadline/deadline_server?project=YOUR_PROJECT`.
7. **Get AYON_API_KEY**: Visit `http://YOUR_AYON/settings/users`, create a new service account user, and click on generate a new key. Store this key as you'll need it for the Deadline [AYON Plug-in](#ayon-plug-in) configuration.

:::note guide
You could check [deadline guide](https://community.ynput.io/t/ayon-openpype-deadline-setup/468) for more detailed steps and additional tips.
:::

### Authentication
Deadline supports username and passwords authentication to protect webservice from unwanted requests. (In Deadline `Tools>Configure Repository Options>Web Service Settings>Require Authentication`)

![](assets/deadline/deadline_authentication.png)

For this, admins need to enable authentication in the addon settings. See [System Deadline Webservice Info](#system-deadline-webservice-info).


### Deadline Custom Plug-ins

The AYON Deadline addon requires a few custom plugins to be installed.

:::info
The Deadline custom plugins and the GlobalJobPreLoad script come with the AYON Deadline addon.
In the Deadline addon, you'll find a repository overlay that you can copy into the Deadline repository to make it work.

To get the custom plugins, you can either download the addon `.zip` package from [ayon-deadline/releases - GitHub](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-deadline/releases) or find the downloaded one using the launcher on your machine. By default, the addon downloads to the path saved in the `AYON_ADDONS_DIR` environment variable.
The files should be in the `deadline_x.x.x/client/ayon_deadline/repository` directory.
:::

Custom Plugins:
- [AYON Plug-in](#ayon-plug-in)
- [CelAction Plug-in](#celaction-plug-in)
- [Harmony AYON Plug-in](#harmony-ayon-plug-in)
- [Unreal Engine 5 Plug-in](#unreal-engine-5-plug-in)
- [Husk Standalone Plug-in](#husk-standalone-plug-in) *This one is not shipped with deadline addon. Get it from [Husk Standalone Deadline Submitter - Github](https://github.com/BigRoy/HuskStandaloneSubmitter)*

#### AYON Plug-in

The `AYON` Deadline Plug-in must be configured to point to a valid AYON executable location. The executable need to be installed to
destinations accessible by DL process. Check permissions (must be executable and accessible by Deadline process)

- Enable `Tools > Super User Mode` in Deadline Monitor
- Go to `Tools > Configure Plugins...`, find `AYON` in the list on the left side, find location of AYON
executable. It is recommended to use the `ayon_console` executable as it provides a bit more logging.
- In case of multi OS farms, provide multiple locations, each Deadline Worker goes through the list and tries to find the first accessible
 location for itself.
- provide your Ayon server address and API key for service account generated in step 6 of [Preparation](#Preparation)
- provide additional servers if needed, they should follow this format: `{server url}@{token}`, e.g., `http://11.2.3.47@myapikey1`.
  - See [add-ayon-server-to-farm-job](#add-ayon-server-to-farm-job)

![](assets/deadline/deadline_configure_plugin.png)

#### CelAction Plug-in

It's required for CelAction submissions via deadline addon.
![](assets/deadline//celaction_dl_plugin.png)

#### Harmony AYON Plug-in

It's required for Harmony submissions via deadline addon.
![](assets/deadline/harmonyayon_dl_plugin.png)

#### Unreal Engine 5 Plug-in

It extends the official Unreal5 Plugin to support Unreal Perforce submissions.
It implements `PreLoad` scripts that syncs your project to change list id within the exported `changelist` before rendering.
For more info, check [Version Control - Support for Unreal and Deadline](addon_version_control_admin_get_started.md#support-for-unreal-and-deadline) and [Version Control - Deadline](addon_version_control_artist.md#deadline)

:::info
Unreal submissions via deadline addon requires `ayon-version-control` addon and configured (P4 credentials etc.). See [Version Control - Addon Settings](addon_version_control_admin_settings.md#addon-settings)
:::

![](assets/deadline//unreal5_dl_plugin.png)


#### Husk Standalone Plug-in

It's required for Houdini `usdrender` submissions via deadline addon.

:::info
This plugin is not shipped with `ayon-deadline` addon. 
It's also a repository overlay, so you can copy its content directly to your Deadline repository. Get it from [Husk Standalone Submitter](https://github.com/BigRoy/HuskStandaloneSubmitter)

If you have the `PATH` configured in your application addon as mentioned in  [How to submit houdini patch version to deadline?](addon_houdini_admin.md#how-to-publish-lookdev-from-houdini-), then you'd be able to only use `husk.exe` instead of the full path.

### Add AYON server to farm job
> Setting Location: `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/CollectAYONServerToFarmJob`

:::tip
This feature is handy for submissions from a separate AYON dev server.
:::

![](assets/deadline/add_ayon_server_to_farm_job.png)

When enabled, submit your current `AYON_SERVER_URL` with the job to enforce using your current server. Based on this value Deadline can connect to different AYON (`production` or `development` installation for example).
This requires modifying the Deadline AYON plugin configuration to add additional AYON servers. See [Deadline AYON Plug-in](#ayon-plug-in).


### Validate Expected Files
> Setting Location: `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/ValidateExpectedFiles`

![](assets/deadline/validate_expected_files.png)

1. **Enable**: Turn on the main toggle of the plugin. Disable it to have the system ignore it.
2. **Active**: Disable this to deactivate the plugin. The system will recognize the plugin, but it won't function.
3. **Allow user change frame range**
4. **Trigger on families**: List of `families` to determine which ones the validator will affect.
5. **Trigger for plugins**: List of `targets` to determine which ones the validator will affect.

### Houdini Submit render to deadline
> Setting Location: `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/HoudiniSubmitDeadline`

:::info
To save on licenses, *in compliance with the native Deadline node,* Houdini render submission supports splitting the render into two jobs:
- **Export Job:** This job uses Houdini to handle exporting caches or intermediate render files, like `.ass` or `.ifd`.
- **Render Job:** This job uses a separate Deadline plugin from Houdini to process these intermediate files, such as `Arnold` for `.ass` or `Mantra` for `.ifd`.
:::

       1. **host_name**: Pipeline integration name supplied by an AYON addon.
       2. **AOV Regex**: AOV regex patterns for AOV filters.
       3. **+**: Add more AOV regexes 
   2. **+**: Add more filters


## Troubleshooting

### Publishing jobs fail directly in DCCs

- Double check that all previously described steps were finished
- Check that `deadlinewebservice` is running on DL server
- Check that user's machine has access to deadline server on configured port

### Jobs are failing on DL side

Each publishing from AYON consists of 2 jobs, first one is rendering, second one is the publishing job (triggered after successful finish of the rendering job).

![Jobs in DL](assets/deadline_fail.png)

- **<font size="4"> Jobs are failing with `AYON executable was not found` error </font>**

    Check if AYON is installed on the Worker handling this job and ensure `AYON` Deadline Plug-in is properly [configured](#configuration)


- **<font size="4"> Render jobs are failing with `Got invalid credentials. Invalid API key for...` error </font>**

    If you are sure that you provided correct AYON API key in Deadline `Configure Plugin`, check if you have enabled Deadline Secrets Management. 
    
    You will need to grant access to secrets to user or machine.

    You will need to run this command on Deadline Server machine:

    `deadlinecommand secrets GrantKeyAccessToServer {SECRETS_USER} defaultKey {NODE_ID}`

    See more details [Deadline Secrets Management - GrantKeyAccessToServer](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/secrets-management/deadline-secrets-management.html#deadline-secrets-management-command-grantkeyaccesstoserver)


- **<font size="4"> Publishing job is failing with `ffmpeg not installed` error </font>**

    AYON executable has to have access to `ffmpeg` executable, check AYON `ayon+settings://ayon_third_party`

    ![FFmpeg setting](assets/ffmpeg_path.png)

- **<font size="4"> Both jobs finished successfully, but there is no review on Ftrack </font>**

    Make sure that you correctly set published family to be send to Ftrack.

    ![Ftrack Family](assets/ftrack/ftrack-collect-main.png)

    Example: I want send to Ftrack review of rendered images from Harmony :
        - `Host names`: "harmony"
        - `Families`: "render"
        - `Add Ftrack Family` to "Enabled"

    Make sure that you actually configured to create review for published product in `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/ProcessSubmittedJobOnFarm`

    ![Ftrack Family](assets/deadline_review.png)

    Example: I want to create review for all reviewable products in Harmony :
      - Add "harmony" as a new key an ".*" as a value.


- **<font size="4"> Rendering jobs are stuck in 'Queued' state or failing </font>**

    Make sure that your Deadline is not limiting specific jobs to be run only on specific machines. (Eg. only some machines have installed particular application.)

    Check job info [profiles](#profiles).

    ![Deadline group](assets/deadline/deadline_group.png)

    Example: I have separated machines with "Harmony" installed into "harmony" group on Deadline. I want rendering jobs published from Harmony to run only on those machines.
