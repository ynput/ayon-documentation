### Create Default Tags

This tool will recreate all necessary AYON tags needed for successful publishing. It is automatically ran at start of the Hiero/NKS. Use this tool to manually re-create all the tags if you accidentally delete them, or you want to reset them to default values.

#### Result

-   Will create tags in Tags bin in case there were none
-   Will set all tags to default values if they have been altered

### Apply Colorspace Project

This tool will set any defined colorspace definition from AYON `Settings / Project / Anatomy / Color Management and Output Formats / Hiero / Workfile` to Hiero `menu / Project / Edit Settings / Color Management tab`

#### Result

-   Define correct color management settings on project

### Apply Colorspace Clips

This tool will set any defined colorspace definition from AYON `Settings / Project / Anatomy / Color Management and Output Formats / Hiero / Colorspace on Inputs by regex detection` to any matching clip's source path.

#### Result

-   Set correct `Set Media Color Transform` on each clip of active timeline if it matches defined expressions

## Publishing Shots

<div class="row markdown">

With AYON, you can use Hiero/Nuke Studio as a starting point for creating a project's **shots** as *assets* from timeline clips with its *hierarchycal parents* like **episodes**, **sequences**, **folders**, and its child **tasks**. Most importantly it will create **versions** of plate *products*, with or without **reference video**. Publishig is naturally creating clip's **thumbnails** and assigns it to shot *asset*. Hiero also supports publishing **audio** *product* and various **soft-effects** either as retiming component part of published plates or **color-tranformations**. Those will be available later on for compositor artists to use either as *viewport input-process* or *loaded nodes* in the graph editor.

### Preparing a timeline for publishing shot, plates and more
Data conversion is not part of the process, so when working with raw camera sources or other formats which need to be converted for 2D/3D work, we recommend to convert those first and use those in the timeline. Before any clips in timeline could be converted to publishable instances we recommend following.
1. Reduce track amount by merging all tracks that can be one
2. Rename tracks to follow basic structure. Please avoid using `[-/_.,%&*]` or spaces. These names will be later used in *product* name creation as `{family}{trackName}` so for example **plateMain** or **plateFg01** 
	> if only one track it can be `main`
	> when dealing with multiple layers (elements) for one shot then use `main` and other elements for example: `bg`, `greenscreen`, `fg01`, `fg02`, `display01`, etc. 
3. Define correct `Set Media Color Transform` at all clips as those will be also published to metadata and used for later loading with correct color transformation.
4. Additional reviewable video material which you wish to be used as preview videos on any supported Project manager platform (Ftrack) has to be added ideally to track named **review**. This can be offline edit used as reference video for 2D/3D artists. This video material can be edited to fit length of **main** timeline track or it can be one long video clip under all clips in **main** track, because AYON will trim this to appropriate length with use of FFMPEG. Please be aware we only support MP4(h264) or JPG sequence at the moment.

### Converting timeline clips to instances

Every clip on timeline which is intended to be published has to be converted to publishable instance.

<div class="col col--6 markdown">

In AYON it is done by tagging a clip with our own metadata. Select all clips you wish to convert then `menu > AYON > Create`.
<br></br><br></br>

</div>

<div class="col col--6 markdown">

![Create menu](assets/hiero_menuCreate.png)

</div>

<div class="col col--6 markdown">

Then chose `Create Publishable Clip` in **Creator** editor.
<br></br>
</div>

<div class="col col--6 markdown">

![Instance Creator](assets/hiero_instanceCreator.png)

</div>
<div class="col col--6 markdown">

In the create options, you can define instances' properties.
You might want to let `use only selected clip(s)` to only mark current selection as publishable clips.
If you wish to rename clips dynamically during creation then Keep  **Rename clips** ticked.
<br></br>

In case you wish to use *multiple elements of shots* workflow then ensure **Enable vertical sync** is ticked on and choose the correct hero track which is holding main plates, this is usually the **main** track.
</div>

<div class="col col--6 markdown">

![Create menu](assets/hiero_createUIRename.png)

</div>
<div class="col col--6 markdown">

Product name is created dynamically if `<track_name>` is selected on **Product name**.
<br></br>

In case you wish to publish reviewable video as explained above, then find the appropriate track from drop down menu **Use review track**. Usually named `review`
<br></br>

Hover above each input field for help.
<br></br>

Handles can be defined here too. In order to have individual clip set differently we recommend to set here a default value and change those later in the created AYON shot instances under `handleStart` and `handleEnd` properties (look below for details).
</div>

<div class="col col--6 markdown">

![Create menu](assets/hiero_createUIFrames.png)

</div>
<div class="col col--6 markdown">

After you hit **Create** new instances get added in the "Products to publish section". Also custom AYON tags are added to selected clips (except clips in **review** tracks).
<br></br>

If you wish to change any individual properties of the shot then you are able to do it directly on the instance under the `Publish` widget. In this example we can change `handleStart` and `handleEnd` to some other values.

<br></br>
Action the **Publish** button to trigger the publishing process for the active instances.

### Publishing Effects from Hiero to Nuke
This video shows a way to publish shot look as effect from Hiero to Nuke.

# Nuke Build Workfile
This is a tool of Node Graph initialisation using a pre-created template.

### Add a profile
The path to the template that will be used in the initialisation must be added as a profile on Project Settings.

![Create menu](assets/nuke_addProfile.png)

### Create Place Holder

![Create menu](assets/nuke_createPlaceHolder.png)

This tool creates a Place Holder, which is a node that will be replaced by published instances.

![Create menu](assets/nuke_placeHolderNode.png)
#### Result
- Create a red node called `PLACEHOLDER` which can be manipulated as wanted by using it in Node Graph.

![Create menu](assets/nuke_placeholder.png)

:::note
All published instances that will replace the place holder must contain unique input and output nodes in case they will not be imported as a single node. 
:::

![Create menu](assets/nuke_publishedinstance.png)


The information about these objects are given by the user by filling the extra attributes of the Place Holder

![Create menu](assets/nuke_fillingExtraAttributes.png)



### Update Place Holder
This tool allows the user to change the information provided in the extra attributes of the selected Place Holder.

![Create menu](assets/nuke_updatePlaceHolder.png)



### Build Workfile from template
This tool imports the template used and replaces the existed PlaceHolders with the corresponding published objects (which can contain Place Holders too). In case there is no published items with the description given, the place holder will remain in the node graph.

![Create menu](assets/nuke_buildWorfileFromTemplate.png)

#### Result
- Replace `PLACEHOLDER` node in the template with the published instance corresponding to the information provided in extra attributes of the Place Holder

![Create menu](assets/nuke_buildworkfile.png)

:::note
In case the instance that will replace the Place holder **A** contains another Place Holder **B** that points to many published elements, all the nodes that were imported with **A** except **B** will be duplicated for each element that will replace **B**
:::

### Update Workfile
This tool can be used to check if some instances were published after the last build, so they will be imported.

![Create menu](assets/nuke_updateWorkfile.png)

:::note
Imported instances must not be deleted because they contain extra attributes that will be used to update the workfile since the place holder is been deleted.
